MEC_FCB1010 controller for use with Ableton Live 10

1. Inside the Midi Remote Scripts folder is A_FCB1010. Copy this folder to C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 10 Standard\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts
This will show up in ableton settings under contol surface as A_FCB1010

2. Inside the Manuals_Programs folder is the PC Editor software for the FCB1010. 
Factory reset the pedal and use the software to send the MEC_FCB1010.syx file to the pedal to program ALL banks and pedals as per the 3x JPG's (FCB1010_Bank_00.jpg,FCB1010_Bank01_thru_08.jpg,FCB1010_Bank_09.jpg)

Load Ableton and you can select the surface controller A_FCB1010
This should give a RED (colour based on it being first devic, may vary if subsequent devices) 8 track wide 5 scene deep box

(* if no red box shows the script has not run or has been edited and there is an error, also if A_FCB1010 does not show up in the contoller list)

FCB1020 revision 4 for Live 10

I wouldnt have been able to complete this version without their help and work and of course the online forum community for little bits of info here and there. 
This has been a great XMAS2020 project to get my new toy working the way I want it with Ableton ;-)

I offer the work as is with no garauntee or support but was fully functional as of today 31-12-2020 using Ableton 10.1.30
Anyone has MY permission to use this code and edit it. As far as I know the 2 links above offered the same open usage of the code.
